# Anti-Varroa System  #

##  POPSchool project : Anti varroa system, to protect hives. ## 

This project is done at PopSchool. It is an attempt to build a cheap & reproductible system that will destroy Varroa Destructor directly into the hives.

The main objectif is to manage to heat-up the hive to a temperature of 45° for two hours. This should kill varroa, without killing the bees.
